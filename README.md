# NeuralSolver: Differentiable Solver Search for Fast Diffusion Sampling

![](./figs/coeffs_timestep2.png)
This repository contains the code for the paper:
**Differentiable Solver Search for Fast Diffusion Sampling**
#### [NEWS] [11.25] üç∫ Our searched NeuralSolvers and corresponding code are now available in the official repo!

## Methods
Our motivation is that Adams-like linear multi-step methods employ lagrange interpolations, ignoring the *x* related terms.
So we defines a universal interpolation function `P(x, t)` and directly estimate the pre-intergal **coefficients and timesteps** used in the sampling.

## Expertiments

Compared to Linear-Multi-Step Methods, our NeuralSolvers(searched on FlowDCN-B-R256) consistently improve the FID metrics by a large margin respectively.

We provide a adams-like linear-multi-step solver for the recitified flow sampling. The related configs are named with `adam2` or `adam4`. The solver code are placed in `./src/diffusion/flow_matching/adam_sampling.py`.

Compared to Henu/RK4, the linear-multi-step solver is more stable and faster.
